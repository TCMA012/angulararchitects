one of the most known NgModules in Angular was the CommonModule . It contains built-in
directives like *ngIf or *ngFor and built-in pipes like async or json . While you can still import the
whole CommonModule , meanwhile it’s also possible to just import the needed directives and pipes:

import {
AsyncPipe,
JsonPipe,
NgForOf,
NgIf
} from "@angular/common";



the easiest approach for grouping stuff that goes together is using folders. However, you
might go one step further by leveraging barrels:
A barrel is an EcmaScript file that exports related
elements.
These files are often called public-api.ts or index.ts .



define path mappings for your barrels you import from in your TypeScript configuration ( 
tsconfig.json in the project’s root):
"paths": {
"@demo/shell": ["src/app/shell/index.ts"],
[...]
}
